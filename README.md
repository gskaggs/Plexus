You're a strange robot stranded in a strange land. Collect coins and hearts, avoid the flying red spikes, and make it through each challenging level to save your true love.

Use the left / right arrow keys to glide and the up arrow key to jump. Hit esc to pause, and make sure to save your state before powering off.
